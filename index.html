              Modern digital experiences require smarter methodologies, better
              technologies, and innovative approaches to win users’ trust and
              attention. Cloud-native technologies have the potential to deliver
              sophisticated software solutions with such experiences. Simform
              gives you access to seasoned cloud architects, skilled DevOps
              experts, cross-functional agile teams, and proficient data
              engineering experts. Whether it be modernizing an aging software,
              building a solution from scratch, or modifying infrastructure to
              keep up with business growth, Simform utilizes the best cloud
              practices and methodologies to fulfill your business goals.

              Let us know about your project needs and goals—the more detailed
              the better. Depending on your goals, we prepare a tech roadmap

              add a member to your existing tech team or build a standalone
              project from scratch, we can help you find the best developers for
              the job and make sure the project is successfully delivered on
              time.Most of our developers work remotely and are experienced in
              working with distributed teams. If an on-site developer is
              strictly required, we can certainly work with you to make it
              happen. We can tap into our partner network and a vetted list of
              developers to help you find a local developer.

              Simform’s tried and tested engagement model of team extension has

              <h2>What does your development process look like?</h2>
              <p>1) Test Cases Driven User Stories for Clear Requirements -
              When our engagement with the client starts we help them create detailed user stories and scope out the next few sprints.</p>
              
             <p> 2) Intense Sprint Planning
              In order to execute projects on time, you need to plan sprints as</p>
              <p>3) Iterative Delivery
                Typically, in an agile development process, we will divide the implementation process into several checkpoints rather than a single deadline. They are called iterations and are part of each sprint.</p>
                
                <p>4) Documentation
                We document everything from application and code level architecture decisions, to live user stories document, to design focused UX/UI/Design System documents.</p>
                
                <p>5) Constant Communication and Retrospective
                Stand-Up Each workday begins with a brief team stand-up meeting to discuss what we did yesterday, and what we plan to do today.</p>
                
                <p>6) Code review
                A successful peer review strategy for code review requires a balance between strictly documented processes and a non-threatening, collaborative environment.</p>
                
                <p>7) Integrating QA in the development process
                We have gotten much better about integrating QA in our development process. We used to loop QA in after our code was pushed to the master branch, which was clunky.</p>
                
                <p>Now our QA engineers will identify and create a test plan as soon as we begin working on the next sprint. As initial development nears completion, an engineer and a QA engineer will run through test scenarios together.</p>
                
                <p>8) Post-release
                It’s important to circle back and review how the process went once you’re done, be it a success or failure.</p>
                
                <p></p>Did the testing rightly model the production scenario?
                Did your team correctly estimate the effort required to release a product?
                How is the product running in production?</p>
                
                <p>Review how well the team performed by revisiting the implementation and testing checkpoints. Your team will adjust their performance accordingly as they grow used to being held accountable for every step in this process.</p>
