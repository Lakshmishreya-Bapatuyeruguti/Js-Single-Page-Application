              Modern digital experiences require smarter methodologies, better
              technologies, and innovative approaches to win users’ trust and
              attention. Cloud-native technologies have the potential to deliver
              sophisticated software solutions with such experiences. Simform
              gives you access to seasoned cloud architects, skilled DevOps
              experts, cross-functional agile teams, and proficient data
              engineering experts. Whether it be modernizing an aging software,

              strictly required, we can certainly work with you to make it
              happen. We can tap into our partner network and a vetted list of

              When our engagement with the client starts we help them create detailed user stories and scope out the next few sprints.</p>
              
             <p class="sectionContent"> 2) Intense Sprint Planning

              <p class="sectionContent">3) Iterative Delivery
                Typically, in an agile development process, we will divide the implementation process into several checkpoints rather than a single deadline. They are called iterations and are part of each sprint.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionContent">4) Documentation
                We document everything from application and code level architecture decisions, to live user stories document, to design focused UX/UI/Design System documents.</p>

                A successful peer review strategy for code review requires a balance between strictly documented processes and a non-threatening, collaborative environment.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionContent">7) Integrating QA in the development process
                We have gotten much better about integrating QA in our development process. We used to loop QA in after our code was pushed to the master branch, which was clunky.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionContent">Now our QA engineers will identify and create a test plan as soon as we begin working on the next sprint. As initial development nears completion, an engineer and a QA engineer will run through test scenarios together.</p>
                
                <p class="sectionContent">8) Post-release
                It’s important to circle back and review how the process went once you’re done, be it a success or failure.</p>
